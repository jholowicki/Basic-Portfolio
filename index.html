        Joy has served as a technical and project management assistant on high-technology projects for over 6 years. Her current role as project coordinator at Ailey Solar Electric involves streamlining a lengthy solar design and sales to solar installation to operating phase project pipeline and maintaining regulatory compliance while relaying between government, business, and client communications. Before her work in solar, she was technical assistant to a 20-plus scientist NIH biochemistry lab, the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics, dealing in a number of technical disciplines such as large inventory management, technical machine maintenance and troubleshooting, and LIMS database management.

      	In addition to her technical background, Joy is a creative activist and nonprofit builder in the Chicago. She lead and organized with Rising Tide Chicago, an all-volunteer group dedicated to climate justice, for three years. Notable contributions of Rising Tide Chicago to the community include their participation in the Ban Petcoke Coalition in 2015 and their push against horizontal hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) in Illinois from 2013-2015. These campaigns are widely considered successful by their advocates: new petcoke regulation has effectively shutdown open petcoke piling in Chicago and regulatory delay by activists coincided with a market downturn in the fracking industry, meaning little to no fracking operations exist in Illinois. Currently, she is serving as a board member of Archipelago non-profit and just opened an autonomous social center in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago.
